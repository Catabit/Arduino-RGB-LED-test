# Arduino-RGB-LED-test

This project tests a typical RGB led controlled by 3 PWM signals from an arduino. There is one input button for switching the current adjusted color and a knob to actually input an analog value to the board (so it can output an according PWM signal). A display is also added to show the current R, G and B values (0-255).
